Hello there visitor, and welcome to my site!

*What is this about?* It's about computer science and software development topics or projects I feel like discussing.

<!-- more -->

At the moment, I am focusing hard on an [Original Xbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_(console)) emulator called [StrikeBox](https://github.com/StrikerX3/StrikeBox), which currently doesn't do much except boot a virtual x86 environment, run the Xbox BIOS ROMs and load a game from an XISO or a system dashboard from a virtual hard drive. I'm a member of the Xbox emulator development community; you may have heard of [Cxbx-Reloaded](https://github.com/Cxbx-Reloaded/Cxbx-Reloaded) or [XQEMU](https://github.com/xqemu/xqemu/).

Another project I've been working on is [virt86](https://github.com/StrikerX3/virt86), a library that abstracts away the specifics of interfacing with x86 virtualization platforms such as [Intel HAXM](https://github.com/intel/haxm), [KVM](https://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page) and [Windows Hypervisor Platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/api/).

I'm passionate about low-level/systems software development, but I can write almost any kind of software, from tiny toys to scalable services in the cloud. Just don't ask me about front-end. ðŸ˜‰

[Here's my GitHub profile](https://github.com/StrikerX3); you can find it below too. I also have a [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/StrikerX3) page, for those of you feeling generous or grateful for my work. Your support is truly appreciated!

Expect to see posts on progress made in any of my software projects, mentions of other projects I like and occasional computer science topics, and perhaps a tutorial or two.
